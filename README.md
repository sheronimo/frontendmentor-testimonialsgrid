## Overview

Hi! This is my attempt at the Testimonial grid section. This was a pretty fun challenge to test my knowledge of CSS Grid. The challenge was fairly straightforward, and Grid being a very robust and powerful tool meant that my solution didn't require overcomplicated logic and manually adjusting each testimonial component inside the grid.

## My process

1. I first overhauled the markup and made sure each testimonial used identical semantic markup.
2. I then worked on styling the grid itself and the appearance of testimonials, before then positioning and sizing the grid items in accordance with the design document.
3. I then added finishing touches to match both the desktop and mobile design images, such as adjusting spacing and font sizing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I learned about how to work with Grid items of different sizes and how to position them such that they appear differently on different screen sizes.
